## Abstract

Misinformation spread through social media poses a grave threat to public health, interfering with sound medical advice most visibly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. To track and curb misinformation, an essential first step is to identify and track the spread of lies related to public health. One component of misinformation detection is finding examples of misinformation posts that can serve as training data for misinformation detection algorithms. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of collecting high quality training data in misinformation detection applications. To that end, we propose a simple but effective methodology and show its viability on five myths related to COVID-19. Our methodology uses both keywords and weak learner predictions for sampling, resulting in a high rate of identification for myths in example posts. To aid researchers in adjusting this methodology for other use cases, we use word usage entropy to describe when fewer iterations of sampling and training will be needed to obtain high quality samples. Finally, we present a case study that shows the prevalence of three of our myths on Twitter at the beginning of the pandemic.
